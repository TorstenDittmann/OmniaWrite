<!-- ABOUT OMNIAWRITE -->

## About OmniaWrite

OmniaWrite is a next-generation plain text editor engineered for creative writing. It is perfect for writing novels, lyrics, poems, essays, drafts and screenplays.

Writing a good story is one of the most challenging things in life. But for many it is a dream worth pursuing.

OmniaWrite doesn't help you create a novel out of nothing, but is a faithful companion at every step of your projects. Organisation, environment for concentrated work, export to all common file formats and much more.

#### Full Featured Text Editor
Everything you need. Nothing you don’t.

#### Chapters and Scenes
Write in chapters and scenes to give your text more structure and add manageability. You can move and rearrange scenes at will without having to break your structure.

#### Anywhere
OmniaWrite will support Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS and can also run in any modern browser.
